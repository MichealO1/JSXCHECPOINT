WELCOME TO MY JSX CHECKPOINT

In this checkpoint, I practiced what we’ve learned in this Super Skill.

Carefully follow these instructions:

Instructions
Create a project using create-react-app.
Convert this code into JSX and put it in the App.js file.
Make sure you add two images, “imageInPublic.jpg” in the public folder and “imageInSrc.jpg” in the src folder.
Make an external file called style.css and add a style for the classes “title” and “red”.
